# TOP Foundation - recipes HTML Project

From the initial DOCTYPE to fundemental tags such as headings for proper outline structure, ordered and unordered lists, and images, I demonstrate my knowledge of the course material to construct a semantic HTML recipe card.

Basic concepts are tag nesting, attributes, and linking embedded content as well as relative link file structure.
